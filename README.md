This is a Java interface for performing basic linear algebra calculations, including:

Matrix multiplication (matrix-matrix and matrix-vector)
Matrix transpose
Matrix inverse
System resolution using direct methods (LU decomposition, Gaussian elimination with/without pivoting, Gaussian elimination (Jordan method), Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (Gaussian elimination, Jacobi iteration)
This project aims to provide a flexible and easy-to-use interface for developers working with numerical algorithms.

**Features**

-Supports dense and sparse matrices and so many other types such(Symetric ones /definete positive ) .

-Optimized algorithms for banded matrices (lower and upper) and triangular matrices to improve performance.

-Provides efficient matrix multiplication implementation
-Offers both direct and iterative methods for system resolution with an improved performance.

**Note**

This is a school project and is open to improvements and further testing.
